# Waybar Microphone and Camera Usage Indicator

A simple bash script that outputs "MIC" and "CAM" respectively if either is in use. Intended for use in Waybar as I could not find a suitable alternative. The checks being used are hardcode to fit my setuo, but I have left comments to indicate what needs to change between setups.
